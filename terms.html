<p>22.1 Rider Tip (as defined herein) is applicable for all Orders except for cash-on-delivery orders and Orders delivered by Vendor Delivery. When you place an Order on the Platform, you will have the option to pay a tip to the rider assigned to deliver your Order (“Rider Tip”). foodpanda will collect payment for the Rider Tip using the payment method chosen by you for the Order. The rider will receive the full amount of any Rider Tip you choose to make once the delivery is completed.</p>
<p>22.2 For Orders cancelled before delivery, foodpanda will process a refund of any Rider Tip paid by you to the payment method used for the Order. Refunds will require time to be processed by us, your credit card company and/or your bank. It can take anywhere from five (5) to seven (7) business days (or even up to 30 days for overseas banks) for your refund to be processed and reflected in your account.</p>
<p>22.3 Rider Tips are not refundable once the Order has been delivered by the rider.</p>
<p>22.4 If you have any questions or issues regarding your Rider Tip, please reach out to our customer support via email or the in-app chat feature available on the Platform.</p>
